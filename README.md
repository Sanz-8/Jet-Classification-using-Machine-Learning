# Jet-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
In this notebook, I try to distinguish jet's from the background.I try three different Machine Learning algorithm to classify the jets. 
First, I used XGBoost Classifier to distinguish the jets, then I tried with CNN  and finally,
I used transfer learning with ResNet50 to distinguish the particle. 
The datasets for this analysis is obtained from HuggingFace("dl4phys/top_tagging").
